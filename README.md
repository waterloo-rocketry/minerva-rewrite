# Minerva (The Rewrite)

## What is Minerva?

Minerva is a Slack app/bot developed by Waterloo Rocketry to assist with meeting reminders and broadcasting messages
between Slack channels.

## What is the rewrite?

The previous iteration of Minerva runs using serverless functions on AWS. This project aims to rewrite Minerva so it can run on more traditional servers, along with various other improvements such as moving from JavaScript to TypeScript and improving the usability of the bot as a whole.

The original repo for Minerva can be found at https://github.com/waterloo-rocketry/minerva.
